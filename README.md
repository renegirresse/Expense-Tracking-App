The Expense Tracker is a robust tool designed to assist users in managing their finances effectively. It facilitates the accurate recording of expenses, categorization, 
and detailed financial summaries, all aimed at helping users stay within their budget.

**Key Features**

1. Intuitive Interface: Streamlined user input for ease of use.

2. Category Management: Includes predefined categories such as Food, Home, Work, Fun, and Miscellaneous.

3. Persistent Data Storage: Utilizes a CSV file format for secure and reliable data storage.

4. Comprehensive Summarization: Provides a detailed breakdown of expenses by category, overall spending, remaining budget, and per-day budget allocation.

**Technical Specifications**

- Language: Python

- Libraries: Utilized csv, datetime, and calendar libraries.

- Object-Oriented Design: Developed an Expense class to encapsulate expense-related attributes and behaviors. Implemented functions for capturing user input, data persistence, and financial summarization.

- Dynamic Budget Calculation: Computes the remaining budget and daily budget based on the current date and total expenditure.

**Challenges and Learning Outcomes**

Throughout the project, I gained significant insights into Python programming, especially in areas such as file I/O operations, date and time handling, and object-oriented design principles. A key challenge was ensuring accurate user input validation, which was successfully addressed through robust error handling techniques.

**Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements to the Expense Tracker include:

- Integration with financial APIs for real-time data tracking.

- Advanced data visualization to provide deeper insights.

- User authentication for personalized expense management.
